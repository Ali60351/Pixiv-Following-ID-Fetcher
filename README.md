# Pixiv-Following-ID-Fetcher
This is a small script to fetch the IDs of all artists you are following on [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net) while skipping the need to deal with JSON files.

It uses [PixivPy](https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy) to communicate with [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net) and fetches JSON responses.
